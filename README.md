# PaperMining
PaperMining is an open-source web-based reference management tool for collaborative paper writing.
Now you can use a GitHub repository for sharing references and corresponding ideas and thoughts among collaborators! ðŸ¥³
It also supports confimation of thought application to the article.

PaperMining provides four separate modes to support sharing thoughts:
- **Collect**: collect papers for survey
- **Mine**: mine your thought by reading each paper
- **Carve**: organize and revise all thoughts
- **Plant**: plant your thoughts to your article or academic journal

The maintainer's short motivation on this:
> You might have been thought the Git is the most powerful tool to share works on source codes as well as other generic stuff. PaperMining is a branch of this idea. I believe the Git repository can be used in paper writing by sharing enlightening thoughts caught from multiple related papers and by multiple readers. That is the tool, PaperMining. - [Jinki Jung](https://github.com/jinkijung)

## Features
- organized thoughts (or comments) visualization that are captured from multiple papers - *Carve mode*
- configurable thought order - *Carve mode*
- reaction for each thought - *Carve mode*
- checkbox confirmation whether the thought is applied to the manuscript - *Plant mode*
- complete bibtex set exporting - *Plant mode*

## How to use
- We encourage you to start by clicking **use this template** button, enables to keep your resources *private*. Read **Metadata license** section. 
- We also recommend to run your own local server to make commits and pushes, but not as public for the sake of security. This version is not secure!

### Current setup
- Remotely (read-only): the GitHub page of your repository will enable you to explore whole contents.
- Locally (read and write): A local server of each contributor to make updates to the remote repository needs to be setup.

### Local server requirement
- Node.js (required to execute a web server)

### Local server setup
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Move to the repository root folder
- Execute 'npm install'
- Execute the server by 'node index.js'
- Browse 'http://localhost:5000' (can be configured in json/conf/config.json)
- Enjoy!

### Keep update from the PaperMining repository (when you pressed *use this template* button)
Add this repository as a remote.

```
git remote add template https://github.com/JinkiJung/PaperMining.git
```

Then catch up the updates by running,
```
git fetch --all
```

By creating your repository from template, your repository will be an independent one which makes error when you try to merge it with the template. The command has been taught not to allow this by default, with an escape hatch *--allow-unrelated-histories* option to be used in a rare event that merges histories of two projects that started their lives independently.

```
git merge template/master --allow-unrelated-histories
```

You can get the up-to-date state of the repository after resolving conflicts from the merge.
